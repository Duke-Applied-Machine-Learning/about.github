# Hello, and welcome to Duke Applied Machine Learning 2.0! 

This is the new GitHub Organization for DAML starting Spring 2026. This site is intended to be the home of all the project repositories that we will be doing from now on. 

## Teams

We have defined **three** main teams that our vetted members belong in:
  - **Executives:** Are executives of DAML that have admin access here.
  - **Principal Engineers:** Are senior engineers who have completed a DAML Client/Internal Project **and** our DevOps Program. See the DevOps course for more information: https://duke-applied-machine-learning.github.io/DevOps_website/
  - **Senior Engineers:** Are those with AITP certification. See the AITP course here for more details: https://duke-applied-machine-learning.github.io/aitp-website/

For those of you who are simply interested in viewing us, welcome again! Feel free to look around.

## How to join teams

If you have recently completed our AITP certification, you should be receiving an invitation to join our organization as a senior engineer via email. If you have not received one, please contact renzo.larrea@duke.edu.
The same goes for principal engineers and new executives.

## How do DAML projects work here?

Please be patient as we form DAML engineering teams with an appropriate principal engineer acting as the project manager. Once these are done, a new team will be created as a subteam of Senior Engineers that
contains the respective members. These teams will be given triage access to their appropriate project repository, with the project manager having maintenance access.

## I would like to form a project!

That's awesome! If you have ideas for a DAML project for a semester-long ML solution, please feel free to contact dukeappliedmachinelearning@gmail.com or renzo.larrea@duke.edu
